# Rotavator

A basic web app to help manage rotas for clubs and volunteer groups

For example, "make the tea on Tuesdays". Groups tend to use email and spreadsheets, maybe on Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive.
Rotas are made by hand, swaps are difficult and cumbersome, tracking who has done their fair share is hard, letting the group
self organise is tricky. Keeping things up to date is troublesome

# Basics

This is all a work in progress

1. Register/Login
2. Setup members
3. Setup rota(s)
4. Members/Admin assigns availability
5. Rotas created, emails sent out
6. Members/Admin can swap rota duties
